Some tips and tricks about using the Unity Game Engine


### Content Creation Checklist (Models / Textures / Animations)

* Poly Budget: Keep low and light
* Snapped to Origin
  - When creating models, set them to 0, 0, 0 (origin)
* Proper UVs for two channels: textures and lightmaps
* Textures are power of 2 (512, 1,024, 2,048 ...)
  - makes it easier for unity to render
* Creating a clean Directory
* Animations: light, clean and easy to export
* File Formats (.fbx)
